# File uploads

[Загрузка файлов на CSS  и JS с нуля.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vx2PVClSVU)

## Get started
time 4:00

```sh
npm init -y
npm install -D parcel-bundler
touch index.html
touch app.js
touch upload.js
touch theme.css
```

`upload.js` file will contain plugin which we will import in `app.js`. Note, that we needed to use eruda console for modile browsers. that means we cannot use console before it is initialized in our app.
